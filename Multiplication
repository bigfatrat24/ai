% Base case: N1 * 0 is 0
multi(_, 0, 0).

% Recursive case: N1 * N2 is N1 + N1 * (N2 - 1)
multi(N1, N2, R) :-
    N2 > 0,
    N2_1 is N2 - 1,        % Decrease N2 by 1
    multi(N1, N2_1, R1),   % Recursively calculate N1 * (N2 - 1)
    R is N1 + R1.          % Add N1 to the result of the smaller multiplication
