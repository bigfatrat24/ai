% Base cases:
fib(0, 0).  % Fibonacci of 0 is 0
fib(1, 1).  % Fibonacci of 1 is 1

% Recursive case:
fib(N, T) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    N2 is N - 2,
    fib(N1, T1),   % T1 is Fibonacci of N-1
    fib(N2, T2),   % T2 is Fibonacci of N-2
    T is T1 + T2.  % Fibonacci of N is sum of previous two terms
